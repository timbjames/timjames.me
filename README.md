====================

This will be the new platform for my personal Blog.

I have been using Orchard CMS now for the past year, and decided that I was going to move to UmbracoCMS version 6 once is was released. 
Eventually after talking to @buildstarted and @adamralph I decided to follow in their footsteps of using github pages.
